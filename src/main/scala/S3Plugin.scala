/**
  * S3Plugin is a simple sbt plugin that can manipulate objects on Amazon S3.
  *
  * == Example ==
  * Here is a complete example:
  *
  *  - project/plugin.sbt:
  * {{{addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-s3" % "0.8")}}}
  *
  *  - build.sbt:
  * {{{
  * import S3._
  *
  * s3Settings
  *
  * mappings in upload := Seq((new java.io.File("a"),"zipa.txt"),(new java.io.File("b"),"pongo/zipb.jar"))
  *
  * host in upload := "s3sbt-test.s3.amazonaws.com"
  *
  * credentials += Credentials(Path.userHome / ".s3credentials")
  * }}}
  *
  *  - ~/.s3credentials:
  * {{{
  * realm=Amazon S3
  * host=s3sbt-test.s3.amazonaws.com
  * user=<Access Key ID>
  * password=<Secret Access Key>
  * }}}
  *
  * Just create two sample files called "a" and "b" in the same directory that contains build.sbt,
  * then try:
  * {{{$ sbt s3-upload}}}
  *
  * You can also see progress while uploading:
  * {{{
  * $ sbt
  * > set S3.progress in S3.upload := true
  * > s3-upload
  * [==================================================]   100%   zipa.txt
  * [=====================================>            ]    74%   zipb.jar
  * }}}
  *
  *  Please select the nested `S3` object link, below, for additional information on the available tasks.
